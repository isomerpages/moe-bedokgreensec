**“A computer is the most incredible tool we’ve ever seen. It can be a writing tool, a communications centre, a super calculator, a planner, a filer, and an artistic instrument all in one, just by being given new instructions, or software, to work from. There are no other tools that have the power and versatility of a computer. We have no idea how far it’s going to go.”
Steve Jobs**

**Computer Applications**

What are the possibilities that you can do with computers? The invention and advancement of computers have revolutionised the way we live, work and learn. With sound ethics, having the knowledge and skills of using a computer makes a person more efficient. This subject prepares students to be adept and to contribute efficiently and effectively in a society that is increasingly driven by technology. Students learn to be responsible, confident and creative users who can participate and thrive in a digital world.

**Our Curriculum**

The hands-on and interactive nature of the subject effectively engages students in their learning. Through engaged learning, students are equipped with a range of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills that complements the teaching and learning of the various disciplines in secondary school and higher institutes.

Our Enrichment
We believe there is a need for students to acquire skills in using a variety of computer application software and hardware to accomplish tasks and communicate ideas. In order to achieve this, our students are given opportunities to explore more at higher institutes of learning and to make sense of their learning in the real-world.

“It’s not about ideas. It’s about making ideas happen.”
Scott Belsky

**Elements of Business Skills**

**Our Curriculum**

The service sector continues to contribute to Singapore’s economic growth and offer employment opportunities. In this subject, students are provided with opportunities to develop skills, values and attitudes and foundational knowledge for work in the service sector for example in travel and tourism, hospitality and retail industries.

**Our Enrichment**

Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) supported by Halogen Foundation is a programme for youth to educate and inspire them to stay in school, recognise business opportunities, and plan for success in an increasingly Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous (V.U.C.A) world. The NFTE programme helps develop an entrepreneurial mindset and builds confidence. It also helps students to identify and solve problems by thinking out of the box.
