**“Creativity takes courage.”
Henri Matisse**

Creativity is something often thought as being deeply ingrained in everyone. But expressing the things one is passionate about takes courage. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) will create meaningful learning experiences for you to express and share your inner most thoughts. You will be inspired to see how the Performing Arts has the power to move hearts and minds to greater heights.

**Our Curriculum**

The PAssion Programme, specially tailored for all Lower Secondary students, provides them the opportunity to be immersed in the eclectic world of Music, Drama and Dance. Be it interpreting stories through music, exploring their imagination through drama or expressing their feelings through physical movements in dance, students get to create, experiment, and most importantly, grow to be confident learners. At the end of the day, students will have the opportunity to delve in the world of impossibilities.

**Our Enrichment**

Like all things in life, what matters is not where you start from, but where you are now and where you are headed. An extension and pinnacle of the performing Arts is Brillante, our in-house school musical production. Never one to rest on our laurels, Brillante continues to push boundaries of the Arts, creating stories of hope and synergizing the energy of students and staff.
