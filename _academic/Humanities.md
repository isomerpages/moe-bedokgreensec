**“The calling of the humanities is to make us truly human
in the best sense of the word.”
J. Irwin Miller****

Through the work of humanities scholars, we learn about the values of different cultures, about our society and our environment. Their efforts preserve the great accomplishments of the past, help us understand the world we live in, and give us tools to imagine the future. In difficult times, people inevitably turn to the humanities to try to understand adversity.

**Our Curriculum**

The learning of the Humanities prepares students to be thinking students and responsible citizens. The study of humanities, both in its pursuit and the perspective it provides, rewards the student with the skills needed for self-critical reflection, adaptability, and self-regulated learners.

The Humanities teaches ways of living, thinking, and being in the world. It helps students to situate their beliefs within a wider frame of reference and to understand and critically analyze assumptions, traditions, truths, and histories. The Humanities assists students to seek their responsibility for the quality of the lives they lead. It challenges students to realize the importance of participating in the real world, and to change it for the better.

**Our Enrichment**

Have you ever had a chance to work with artefacts that date back to pre-war Singapore or wondered about how archaeologists work?  Students are exposed to archeology to understand what it was like in Singapore in the past in the form of simulation activities as well as having opportunities to work with artefacts at the Yusof Ishak Institute of South East Asian Studies.

In addition, our students are taken through a variety of field work experiences to better understand geographical concepts, make meaning of data collected as well as work collaboratively with their fellow peers.
