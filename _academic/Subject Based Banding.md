*“To provide every child the opportunity to learn and develop the subject-specific strengths at a more demanding level.”*

**Subject-Based Banding**

Subject-Based Banding (SBB) recognises the different abilities of students and allows the students to stretch their potential in the subjects that they are strong and have a keen interest in. Based on a student’s respective PSLE subject grade, a Secondary One Normal (Academic) student may do certain subjects at the Express level. Similarly, a Secondary One Normal (Technical) student may do certain subjects at the Normal (Academic) or Express level. The subjects that are currently being offered at Secondary One are English Language, Mathematics, Science, Mother Tongue Languages.

Two other entry points are opened for Secondary One students to exercise the option to offer the subject at a higher level. At mid-year in Secondary One, students who have demonstrated the positive dispositions to handle the rigour and demand of subjects at a higher level may be offered the opportunity to do so. The other entry point is after the end of year examination in Secondary One. The overall performance of the students for the year will be taken into consideration.

With the implementation of Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB), students will be able to study even more subjects at a level better suited to their strengths and interests. Humanities subjects, (Geography, History and Literature in English) will be offered to Secondary Two Normal (Academic) students with effect from 2020 and to Secondary Two Normal (Technical) with effect from 2021.
