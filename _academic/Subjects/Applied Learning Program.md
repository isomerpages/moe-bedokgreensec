**“Design is so simple. That’s why it’s so complicated.”<br>
Paul Rand**

Ever wondered how a motion sensor light works? Or how a number keypad is able to open the door when the correct code is entered? With an intelligent circuit board, we can instruct it to make decisions when certain conditions are met.

**Our Curriculum**

iInquire.iInnovate. By learning how to code to instruct the Arduino intelligent circuit board to make decisions, we can design simple tools to solve day-to-day problems. The focus of the Applied Learning Programme is to challenge students to design novel solutions for everyday problems faced by the elderly. Alternatively, students may also think of creative strategies to tackle environmental issues.

**Our Enrichment**

Students who show interest and potential are invited to join the Tier Two Applied Learning Programme where students will learn how to troubleshoot their projects and learn more complicated coding language. Students will work together with like-minded peers to create more complicated projects to compete in inter-school competitions. Outstanding students will also be offered internship opportunities in leading innovation companies where they can learn about the newest advances in technology.
