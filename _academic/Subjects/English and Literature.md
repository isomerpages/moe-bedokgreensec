**English & English Literature**

**“Words are our most inexhaustible source of magic.”<br>
J. K. Rowling**

What exactly is that scent that hangs in the air after the rain has come and gone? That’s petrichor! A pleasant smell that frequently accompanies the first rain after a long period of warm, dry weather – and that’s the beauty of the English Language. All the language needs is just 26 letters to weave thoughts and ideas into magic, and such is its charm that it has become one of the world’s most widely used languages.

**Our Curriculum**

Through the use of engaging and enriching pedagogy, the English Language & Literature Department seeks to connect your learning and expand your mind with real-world knowledge and lively discussions. Our passionate teachers strive to nurture you to become empathetic communicators, avid readers and critical thinkers who are able to wield the language with confidence and finesse.

**Our Enrichment**

According to Plato, “Books give a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything.” Our Read@BGSS programme breathes life into the language by transporting you to realms beyond your imagination. If you are interested in the art of speaking, the Public Speaking Programme will provide you with skills and various platforms to groom you into an exceptional orator.
