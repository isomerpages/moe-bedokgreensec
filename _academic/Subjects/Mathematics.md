**Mathematics
"The essence of Mathematics lies in its freedom.”
Georg Cantor**

What does the area under a curve have to do with the cardiac output of the human heart? Our Mathematics programme will create meaningful learning experiences for you to better appreciate the beauty of Mathematics. You will also see first-hand how classroom learning is deeply connected with authentic real-world situations, and how mathematical applications abound everywhere.

**Our Curriculum**

Construct + Apply + Extend = Excellence. This could very well be the law that governs our Mathematics programme. It begins with the process of construction, in which your personal learning experience counts for more. You will then apply this co-constructed knowledge to both regular and non-routine problems, and further extend your learning through opportunities to evaluate and reflect on your work. Perhaps there is a winning formula after all!

**Our Enrichment**

The Mathematics Talent Development Programme aims to groom a pool of Mathematics talents, adept at using computer modelling software to solve real-world problems. If mathematical theory fascinates you, take on opportunities to embark on high-level research. You will also get to pit your skills against your peers through a variety of nationwide mathematical competitions. We see Mathematics as more than just a tool and a body of knowledge. To us, Mathematics is a language that can be acquired and appreciated, with ideas that transcend disciplines. There’s certainly truth in how Mathematics is said to be the language in which the universe was written.
