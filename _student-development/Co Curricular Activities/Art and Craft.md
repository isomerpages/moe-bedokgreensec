**Art and Craft**

A picture is a poem without words. In Art & Craft Club, we explore feelings, thoughts and imagination of the artist and translate the ideas into a painting with a story to tell. Hence, students are given the opportunity to empathise with others.

By going on learning journeys to places such as the Singapore Art Museum and the National Gallery, students are exposed to the fine arts and acquire a greater appreciation for it. We also learn new skills such as leather crafting, pottery making, and string art. In addition, students get to hone their creativity and showcase their talents through competitions such as SYF and the National Youth Business Challenge.
