**Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC)**

Which is more important – nature, or nurture?

Dismayed that it is raining cats and dogs and you can’t go out with your friends as planned? Well, have you ever stepped out into the rain and experienced the cool, refreshing feeling of having raindrops fall on your face? You should try it!

Worried that you will be too tanned if you step out into the sunshine? Well, have you ever experienced the golden hour and witnessed its beauty that falls almost without fail at the end of each day?

In today’s digitised and highly stressful world, it is very easy for us to become lost in the hustle and bustle of life and miss out on the simple things that really matter.

At Outdoor Adventure Club, we embrace nature and the outdoors to nurture you, by taking you on little adventures that will reveal those hidden, joyful treasures that Mother Nature intended for you to discover.

So join us on our camping, field cooking, hiking, rock climbing, caving, fishing, kayaking, sailing, stand-up paddling, windsurfing adventures.

ODAC… where adventure never ends.
