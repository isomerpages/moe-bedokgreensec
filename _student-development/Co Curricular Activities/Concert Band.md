**Concert Band**

Doo-doo-doo-doo. Do you have a tune stuck in your head? In that case, Band may be the place for you! No matter where you go, music is a language everyone can understand. Research has shown that musical training helps improve intellectual skills, raise IQ, improve memory and develop creativity. Learning a musical instrument also teaches you resilience and discipline.

Learn to play music from your favorite pop artists, anime, television or movie soundtrack! Lose yourself in the world of music as each piece is a new story brought to life by you and your fellow bandmates. Enjoy afternoons of playing music after a hectic day of lessons. Don’t fret about not having any music talent or background – our friendly instructors and dedicated seniors will provide for the training needed.
