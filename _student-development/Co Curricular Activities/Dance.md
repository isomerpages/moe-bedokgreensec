**Dance**


*Dance*

**'With every step,**<br>
**every move,**<br>
**every piece,**<br>
**a story is told.'**

We put our heart and soul in each training session as we know how powerful a tool dance can be to tell a story that can touch lives. When we train, we give it our all; we cry, we laugh, we love. We grow from rigorous trainings and thrive from connections forged with our fellow dancers. We push each other to achieve what is seemingly beyond us.

Here, we do not settle for less. At the same time, we lift each other up and believe in one another. Through dance, we build a culture of initiative, compassion, discipline and a spirit of excellence. We believe that hard work triumphs over talent, and perseverance brings success.
