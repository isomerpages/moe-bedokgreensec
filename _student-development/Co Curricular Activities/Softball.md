**Softball**

Did you know that softball was originally called mushball or kitten ball? It was first played as an indoor sport. Everyone associates Softball with the understanding that one is out after three strikes. However, Softball is more than just being called out for strikes.

In Softball, one must remain focused, mentally engaged and play strategically, all whilst ensuring one gets on the bases on the field safely. Whatâ€™s even more interesting is that each Softball game play can differ dramatically from one inning to another.

As Softball players, one must be ready to roll with the swings, slide with style onto the bases and bat the ball as far as possible to score a home run. Here at Bedok Green Secondary School, our passionate softball players always believe in playing with heart, for team and for pride. Softball is more than a game; it's about life.
