**Basketball**

Did you know that the first official basketball game was played in 1892 with nine players? It changed to five by 1898. Peach baskets were also once used as the hoop and, every time someone scored, a referee had to fetch the ball by climbing a ladder. Just imagine how long a game would take! But lucky for us, times have changed and basketball has evolved to be one of the most popular sports in the world.

In Bedok Green Secondary School Basketball, we believe in equipping players with the basic basketball skills through our practices, tournaments and matches throughout the year. Apart from skills on the court, we also provide CCA members with the opportunity to develop their leadership skills â€“ providing opportunities for the senior members to coach the younger players. You will also come to learn that one of the greatest experiences of Basketball will be the people you meet; we come as strangers, grow to be teammates and leave as friends.

In BGSS Basketball, the ball is in your court.
