**Youth Flying Club**

Always wondered how planes fly? Want to build your own glider and fly them? Want to experience flying in a plane? Well, the Bedok Green Secondary School Youth Flying Club can offer you all these and so much more.

In Youth Flying Club, we work together as a team with fellow enthusiasts to build and compete in the annual Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition. We experience the thrill of flying in a Lockheed C130 Hercules aircraft, a Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopter and more.

We also get the opportunity to learn more about aviation, gain leadership skills, interact with students from other schools through various courses and workshops such as the Junior Aviators Course, Flight Leaders Course and Assistant Aviators Course.

So come on, take flight with us!
