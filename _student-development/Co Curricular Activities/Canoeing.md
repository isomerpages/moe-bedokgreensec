**Canoeing**

Ever heard of the phrase it takes a village to raise a child? Similarly, it takes a team to produce an athlete. At each training, the team works together to launch their canoes as well as push each other to perform their best. The canoes and paddles are part and parcel of a canoeist’s life.

As the only water-based sport in the school, one is given the privilege to achieve the 1 and 2 Star Kayaking Award. Through the sport, one emerges with better stamina and resilience.

The team lives by the motto, ‘Every training is a race and every race is a training’ to remind them that every minute on the water is precious and to put up their best fight when competing with others.
