**NPCC**

Have you ever wondered how do the police carry out investigations and manage to solve criminal cases?

In National Police Cadet Corps, we learn what to do in an emergency situation and get an insight on the life of a police officer. Besides campcraft and life skills, cadets are also given an opportunity to practise at the shooting range. In addition, they put on the hat of young detectives in our crime investigation courses. Moreover, cadets strengthen their friendship with squadmates through various activities such as kayaking and area games day.

In NPCC, cadets go through drill sessions and other leadership courses that develops their mental alertness, physical fitness and character.
