Then BGSS Football is the CCA for you.

You will learn about the technical and tactical aspects of the game such as getting back on your feet after being knocked down. You will also learn skill sets and values that will be invaluable to you on and off the pitch.

According to Pelé, one of the greatest footballers ever,

*“Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.”*
