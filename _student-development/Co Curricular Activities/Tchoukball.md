**Tchoukball**


Do you know how did Tchoukball get its name? This strange-sounding name comes from the ‘tchouk’ sound of the ball hitting the frame.

Tchoukball is a high intensity ball game which players are required to jump, throw and catch balls, as well as run around the court. It is a non-contact sport that is excellent for team-building and inculcating the values of self-confidence, resilience and respect. In Bedok Green Tchoukball, we strive to inculcate these values in all of our student athletes.

Tchoukball is a fun team sport that is easy to learn and quick to catch on. So come join us and stay active and fit throughout your secondary school life!
