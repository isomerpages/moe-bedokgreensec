*“You just have to find that thing that's special about you that distinguishes you from all the others, and through true talent, hard work, and passion, anything can happen.”*<br>**Dr. Dre**

Everybody is born with a talent ingrained in them. Here at Bedok Green Secondary School, we groom it!

The Talent Development Programme scouts students who have the potential to be shining gems in their area of strength. We provide platforms for them to further develop and explore their interests and skills, to showcase their talents and become confident, outstanding individuals who strive for excellence and achieve greater success.
