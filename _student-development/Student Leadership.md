**Student Leadership**

<p style="text-align:justify">At Bedok Green Secondary School, our core mission is to cultivate a new generation of student leaders who epitomise  commitment, competence, courage, and compassion. We believe that these qualities are fundamental not only to effective leadership but also to personal growth and character development.<br></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Our Student Leadership Programme offers a wide array of opportunities, providing students with diverse leadership roles. These roles include Student Councillors, Peer Support Leaders, House Leaders, CCA Leaders, and Class Executive Committee members. This diversity allows our students to explore leadership roles that align with their individual interests.<br>

</p><p style="text-align:justify">We maintain a rigorous selection and training process to equip our Student Leaders with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in their leadership roles. Our approach includes the following platforms:<br>
	
* Junior Councillor and Peer Support Leader Selection
* Secondary 3 Student Councillor Training Camp
* Junior Councillors’ Training
* Peer Support Leaders’ Training
* Student Councillor Presidential Elections
* Class Leaders’ Training

</p><p style="text-align:justify">We empower our Student Leaders to take the lead in organising a variety of school events. These events play a significant role in our school's culture and community spirit. Our Student Leaders actively participate in the planning, coordination, and execution of the following school events:<br>
	
* Secondary 1 Orientation Programme
* Youth Day Celebrations
* Teachers’ Day Celebrations
* Peer Support Leaders’ Exhibition
* BGSS Sports Day
* BGSS Cross Country Competition

</p><p style="text-align:justify">By offering our Student Leaders meaningful opportunities to engage in these school events, we enrich the school experience for all students, encourage a strong sense of community, and create an inclusive, uplifting environment. This approach reflects our commitment to nurturing well-rounded, responsible, and empowered individuals who will make positive contributions to both our school and the broader community.</p>
