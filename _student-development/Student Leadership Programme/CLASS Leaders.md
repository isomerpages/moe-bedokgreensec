**CLASS Leaders**

***WAI MON MYO KHINE (COMPASSION 1)***

Through my experience as a CLASS Leader, I gained some confidence in public speaking and also learned how to work in a team. Before my experience as the Class Chairperson of Compassion 1, I have always been introverted and mostly kept to myself. I am now able to speak in front of my class with confidence, gained more awareness of my surroundings and am now capable of working for the good of my class. I have also learnt the importance of being resilient and compassion through working with my classmates, CCA mates and other school mates.
