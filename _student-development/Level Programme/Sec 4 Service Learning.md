**Sec 4 Service Learning**

**BGSS Recycle!**

Once a year, on a bright Saturday morning, the Secondary 4 and 5 students of Bedok Green Secondary School can be seen carrying stacks of old newspapers and bags of donated clothes down the lift of HDB flats. This is our small contribution to helping the environment as we embark on a Recycling Initiative.

This is a great way to start off the year as not only do we get to work with our classmates, we also get to say hi to our neighbours â€“ the residents residing near our school. With a simple knock on the door and a smile on our face, we collect plastic bags filled with old newspapers and clothes and load them up onto a pick-up truck.

After a tiring but eventful day, the proceeds from the collection go to Bizlink, a non-profit organization dedicated to serving the disadvantaged individuals.
