**Sec 1 Orientation and Camps**

**Camp SPRITE**

Camp SPRITE (Spirit of School Pride, Responsibility, Integrity, Teamwork and Excellence) is an annual signature event for Bedok Green Secondary 1 students in January. During this camp, our students go through a series of activities especially conceptualised by our alumni to build teamwork and the RICH values (Resilience, Integrity, Compassion and Humility) in our students. Our main highlight is the campfire where students get to display their talents as a class to audiences comprised of their parents, teachers and schoolmates. What a way to start their journey as a student in Bedok Green Secondary School. Keep the fire burning bright!

**Outdoor Adventure Camp**

The Outdoor Adventure Camp in November aims to provide students with an authentic platform to experience the outdoor living skills. This camp provides students with the opportunity to move out of their comfort zone to learn from different experiences such as the high challenge course, the caving experience as well as kayaking and the land expedition. The camp also allows students to bond with their classmates and teachers and learn the R.I.C.H. (Resilience, Integrity, Compassion, Humility) values through outdoor education lessons.
