**Overseas Values-in-Action (OVIA)**

The OVIA programme offers an opportunity for our students to step out of their comfort zone and develop within them a stronger sense of civic mindedness. During the 3D2N programme, our students will visit the orphanages and schools in Bintan, where they will carry out a series of exciting lessons and interactive games for the children. Our students will also embark on the Safe Water Garden project, where they will construct a water piping system to channel wastewater into a septic tank and allow the nutrient-rich water to seep into a garden for growing crops. Through their interactions with their overseas counterparts, our students are exposed to the social needs and concerns of the community. More importantly, they will gain valuable insights on the importance of steward leadership and step out of their comfort zone in contributing to the greater good!
