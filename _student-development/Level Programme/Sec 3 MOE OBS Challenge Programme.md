**Sec 3 MOE-OBS Challenge Programme**

Secondary 3 MOE-OBS Challenge Programme
At Bedok Green Secondary School, we believe in the holistic development of our students through various outdoor experiences. As part of the National Outdoor Adventure Masterplan as well as the pinnacle programme for the school’s Outdoor Education Programme, our Secondary 3 students participate in the 5 Day 4 Night expeditionary camp at Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) annually. This programme aims to develop resilience, ruggedness as well as cohesion in our students. Through our outdoor education programme, our students are equipped to cope with the rigours of OBS and at the same time, able to enjoy and learn valuable ‘out of classroom’ lessons.
