**Sec 1 Outdoor Adventure Camp**

The Outdoor Adventure Camp in November aims to provide students with an authentic platform to experience the outdoor living skills. This camp provides students with the opportunity to move out of their comfort zone to learn from different experiences such as the high challenge course, the caving experience as well as kayaking and the land expedition. The camp also allows students to bond with their classmates and teachers and learn the R.I.C.H. (Resilience, Integrity, Compassion, Humility) values through outdoor education lessons.
