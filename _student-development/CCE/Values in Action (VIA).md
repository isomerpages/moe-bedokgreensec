*“Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.”*<br>
**Albert Einstein**

Placing yourself in the shoes of others exemplifies our Values-in-Actions programmes.

**Our Curriculum**

In Bedok Green Secondary School, we look out for our neighbours. Our Bedok neighbourhood provides students with opportunities to learn and to give back to the community. From issues such as providing basic necessities like food, to Singapore’s ever-growing elderly community, our students venture out to provide their helping hand and willing hearts.

Students are provided with opportunities to work on projects like Safe Water Gardens, providing a helping hand in villages and orphanages as part of their Overseas Service Learning trip.

Ultimately, our Values-in-Action programme exposes students to the social needs and concerns of the community and helps develop empathy for people from all walks of life.
