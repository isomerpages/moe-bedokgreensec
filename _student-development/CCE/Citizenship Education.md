*“Whoever governs Singapore must have that iron in him. Or give it up. This is not a game of cards. This is your life and mine.”* <br>
**Lee Kuan Yew**

Did you know that the pledge was first recited on 24 August 1966 by about 500,000 students at all 529 government and government-aided schools? Today, we place our fists by our hearts in proud remembrance of the tireless work our pioneer leaders put in to make Singapore what it is today.

**Our Curriculum**

In Bedok Green Secondary School, we shape students’ Citizenship Education experiences through NE commemorative days. From visiting the five pillars of Total Defence to embracing and celebrating diversity in International Friendship and Racial Harmony Day. Our grandest NE experience comes during the joyous birthday of our great nation. We proudly don ourselves in red and burst into national day songs like Count on me Singapore and the all-time favourite Home.
