*“Dreams are extremely important. You can’t do it unless you imagine it.”*<br>
**George Lucas**

When Steve Jobs first started Apple, his aspiration was to get a computer in the hands of everyday people. And today, he has succeeded beyond his wildest dream. Today, Apple is the world’s largest information technology company. This, together with hard work is the power of a dream.

**Our Curriculum**

In Bedok Green Secondary School, we bring students through a journey of discovery. (Who am I?) We expose them to the different options that are available in the education scene. (Where am I going?) We guide them on the different ways towards taking one step closer to their dream. (How do I get there?)

**Our Enrichment**

In Bedok Green Secondary, ECG goes beyond the classroom walls. We have specially invited speakers from the different industries to share during our Industries and Career Day. Students get to learn about what it is to be working in that profession and even ask questions to quench their curiosity. We also provide students with hands-on experiences through our Elective Modules and visits to Polytechnics and ITEs.
