<p><em>“Dreams are extremely important. You can’t do it unless you imagine it.”</em> 
<br><strong>George Lucas</strong>
</p>
<p>When Steve Jobs first started Apple, his aspiration was to get a computer
in the hands of everyday people. And today, he has succeeded beyond his
wildest dream. Today, Apple is the world’s largest information technology
company. This, together with hard work is the power of a dream.</p>
<p><strong>Our Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>In Bedok Green Secondary School, we bring students through a journey of
discovery. (Who am I?) We expose them to the different options that are
available in the education scene. (Where am I going?) We guide them on
the different ways towards taking one step closer to their dream. (How
do I get there?)</p>
<p><strong>Our Enrichment</strong>
</p>
<p>In Bedok Green Secondary, ECG goes beyond the classroom walls. We have
specially invited speakers from the different industries to share during
our Industries and Career Day. Students get to learn about what it is to
be working in that profession and even ask questions to quench their curiosity.
We also provide students with hands-on experiences through our Elective
Modules and visits to Polytechnics and ITEs.</p>
