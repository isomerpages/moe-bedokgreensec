*“Technology is a useful servant but a Dangerous Master.”*<br>
**Christian Lous Lange**

The age of instant information is upon us, and our students are the digital natives. So much power and promise lies in the palm of their hands (literally) but with great power, comes great responsibility. As educators, we have the responsibility to guide our students to be conscientious users of technology.

**Our Curriculum**

In Bedok Green Secondary School, both teachers and students play a part in Cyber Wellness. Apart from our classroom lessons addressing the proper etiquette of using technology, we also have students who take on the role of Cyber Wellness Ambassadors. Together, we work towards building students to be responsible users of the World Wide Web.
