The Green Audit award is an annual environmental audit programme organised by the Singapore Environmental Council (SEC).

The programme requires schools to obtain information such as its usage of electricity, the amount and type of rubbish generated in different areas in the school and green activities organised by the school.

The programme aims to increase the schoolâ€™s level of environmental awareness and encourage each individual to develop solutions and adopt habits to improve their environment.
