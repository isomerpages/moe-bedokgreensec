**Outstanding Alumni**
======================

### **\- Because Old is Gold!**

Students who graduate from Bedok Green often come back to visit and reminisce the time spent here. Many have articulated how the staff in the school showed them care and concern during their years here. Every year, many students return to Bedok Green to help plan and organise Camp SPRITE – a Secondary One Orientation Camp specially held for our Secondary One students.

Our students have done well - many have gone on to higher institutions of their choice and have embarked on careers that they have dreamt about.  Not only are they our pride, they are an inspiration to the juniors too.
