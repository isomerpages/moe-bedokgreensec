**Facilities that will WOW your (school) socks off!**
=====================================================

### **#myfavorite**

A brand new indoor sports hall! Newly-turfed soccer field! Club room with an X-box and numerous board games! Sounds too good to be true?

Thatâ€™s our reality in Bedok Green!

For the more adventurous, a rock wall lies waiting to be scaled. For the ones interested in toning their muscles, our air-conditioned gymnasium will surely not disappoint.

Look forward to using our well-equipped Blackbox to help you further your passion in the arts!

For those who need quiet time and a place to relax, read and learn, our library, which we call the Nexus, offers just the right environment to boost our brain cells working.
