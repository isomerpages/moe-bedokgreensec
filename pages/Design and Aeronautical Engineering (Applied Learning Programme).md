**Design and Aeronautical Engineering (Applied Learning Programme)**
====================================================================

### Â **Breathing life into our learning**

The Design and Aeronautical Engineering (DAE) programme offers students an opportunity to understand aeronautical science and apply their skills in areas beyond the classroom. Through a hands-on and experiential approach students will be able to observe and analyse aeronautical phenomena, conduct experiments, embark on learning journeys and design and create their own flying aircraft models.
