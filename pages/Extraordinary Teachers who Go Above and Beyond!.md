**Extraordinary Teachers who Go Above and Beyond!**
===================================================

###        **- My teacher, my mentor, my friend**

Going the extra mile to help our students shine, is a reflection of our commitment to provide a caring and supportive learning environment. We believe in developing our students holistically. So, with our Year Head system in place, your mental and emotional well-being will always be our top priority. We take pride in the fact that our teachers are well qualified, with one in four teachers having a Masters degree.

Our very own Vice-Principal, Ms Foo Sheue Feng, was a recipient of Outstanding Youth in Education Award in 2003.

Our teachers have also received a number of outstanding awards. Among them are, Mr Lee Beng Wah (President’s Award for Teachers, 2013), Mrs Tang-Lee Choon Tien (EcoFriend Award, Educational Category, 2014), and Mdm Nur ‘Abidah Binte Abdul Rahman (Anugerah Arif Budiman Perangsang, 2015).

In Bedok Green, our teachers take pride in creating innovative and engaging lessons to excite our students. Here are some interesting lessons that you can look forward to!
