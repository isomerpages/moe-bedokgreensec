**Student Leadership**
======================

### **\- We don't just serve, we lead**

Our students have the opportunity to hone their leadership qualities in a number of platforms - for example, in areas of their CCAs (Sports, Uniformed Groups and the Performing Arts), Student Council or even as House Captains.

Student Leaders serve as role models for the larger student population. The leadership experience gained in Bedok Green helps our students cope with the challenges they face and further supports their community outreach in their life journey.
