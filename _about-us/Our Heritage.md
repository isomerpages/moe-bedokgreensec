Bedok Green Secondary School first opened its doors to students on 2 January 2001 at its holding school located at Bedok South Road. The pioneer staff spent three months working on the school vision and mission, designing the school crest, the school crest, the school flag and composing the lyrics for the school song.

The school flag was unfurled for the first time on Youth Day 2001 at the holding school. Its green colour, like the bamboo signifies growth and youthful vibrancy, while the brown colour, representing the rich earth on which the bamboo grows symbolizes rootedness and a sense of belonging to the school and nation.

The Ceremonial Move to the new premises took place on 31 December 2002. The flag was lowered for the last time at the holding school and everyone then walked with great excitement to the new premises. To mark the occasion, a bamboo plant taken from the holding school was planted at the new premises by our principal.

Since 2001, our teaching staff has grown from the original 14 to the current 106 in 2019 supported by 26 non- teaching staff. Our pupil enrolment has also increased from 400 in 2001 to 1086 in 2019. The school has also grown from strength to strength.

Our first Principal, Mrs Song Geok Hua helmed the school from 2001 to 2004. The school principal from 2005-2011, was Mdm Tay Siok Hwa. In 2012, Mr Lim Yu Kee, became the next principal till September 2018. Mr Boy Eng Seng was appointed as Bedok Green’s fourth principal in September 2018.

We are a learning institution built on a foundation of belief that “Every Child Matters.’ We nurture our students into individuals who demonstrate the values of resilience, integrity, compassion and humility. We place great emphasis in providing a holistic education where we believe and grow and where we are ready for the future.

We see our school as a family where students work alongside with staff and acquire new knowledge and develop 21st century competencies through curriculum innovation such as iInquire.ilnnovate, BGSS Passion and through Values in Action programmes.

Through our CCAs, we provide a well-rounded educational experience that not only complements our students’ academic learning, but also contributes to their personal enrichment and growth. Life as a BGSS student is exciting and enriching whether they are developing their physical abilities, aesthetics talents, leadership potential or other skills.
