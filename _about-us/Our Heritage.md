**Our Beginnings**

Bedok Green Secondary School first opened its doors to students on 2 January 2001 at its holding school located at Bedok South Road. The pioneer staff spent three months working on the school vision and mission, designing the school crest, the school flag and composing the lyrics for the school song.

The school flag was unfurled for the first time on Youth Day 2001 at the holding school. Its green colour, like the bamboo, signifies growth and youthful vibrancy. The brown colour, representing the rich earth on which the bamboo grows, symbolizes rootedness and a sense of belonging to the school and nation.

The Ceremonial Move to the new premises took place on 31 December 2002. The flag was lowered for the last time at the holding school and everyone then walked with great excitement to the new premise. To mark the occasion, a bamboo plant taken from the holding school was planted at the new premise by our first principal, Mrs Song Geok Hua.

**The Beginnings of Ping Yi Secondary School**

Ping Yi Secondary School was founded as Pin Ghee Public School in 1930 on Changi Road. It was renamed as Ping Yi Secondary School in 1983, a government co-educational school catering to the schooling needs of children in the Chai Chee neighbourhood. On 24 September 1985, Ping Yi Secondary School was officially opened.  

In 2005, Ping Yi piloted Restorative Practices and began its journey to develop a school culture that is based on positive teacher–student and student–student relationships. Restorative Practices have since become the school’s trademark. 

In an affirmation of the school’s efforts in nurturing students to be creative and inventive thinkers, Ping Yi attained niche status in design education in 2011. In 2012 and 2018, Ping Yi was conferred the prestigious Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations in the Normal Course in recognition of the school’s innovative practices that raised the quality of education in the Normal Course. In 2013, the school was designated the East Zone Centre of Excellence in Design Education to guide and support schools in their drive for innovation and creativity.

In 2016, Ping Yi Secondary School and Bedok Town Secondary School merged to form Ping Yi Secondary School.

**The Merger**

In April 2021, MOE announced that Bedok Green Secondary School will retain its English name in its merger with Ping Yi Secondary School. The Chinese name of Ping Yi Secondary School (平仪中学) is retained to commemorate the history of Pin Ghee Public School – the first Chinese school in the area. The first character of the school name ‘Ping’ (平) means fairness and impartially, while ‘Yi’ (仪) means dignified bearing. 

This new beginning has given rise to a more vibrant learning experiences for our students and allow for a wider range of educational programs and Co-curricular activities (CCAs). We continue with our dedication to nurture our students into individuals who demonstrate the values of resilience, integrity, compassion and humility. Placing great emphasis in providing a holistic education, we provide a well-rounded educational experience that not only complements our students’ academic learning, but also contributes to their personal enrichment and growth. 

Life as a BGSS student is exciting and enriching, developing physical abilities, aesthetics talents, leadership potential and other skills.


Empowered by our mission, we look forward to a bright future as one Bedok Green Secondary School, 平仪中学.
