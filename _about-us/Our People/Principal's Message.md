The most important question to ask yourself when you choose a school is not what you will get, but what you will **_become_**. In Bedok Green Secondary School, our students become the best version of themselves.

Ezell Low was awarded a Distinction award in the 2022 Illustratum Competition organised by NUS. Ethan Yong was awarded the Amazon Future Bursary Award 2022. Tevel Sho Rui Ze, Manasvi Singh, Lee Zhi Qi and Wong Sze Wai Zoe clinched 1st Runner-up in the national POA Quest 2022. Muhammad Ryan Isaac Tang, Althea Mae and Ethan Sim clinched 1st Runner-up in the ignITE Skills Challenge 2022. Nurfarhanah Binti Mohd Salleh, Nur Fatin Binte Mohamed Pahmi and Yaqinn Binti Mohamed Rafi clinched the 3rd prize in the national Malay Finesse TikTok Skit Competition 2022. Ho Ling, Isaac Chia, Cepheus Poh, Ashton Goh, Chen Yasy, Kho Jia En and Jocelyn Tan obtained the Bronze Award in the Chinese Literary Recital Competition 2022.

For our CCAs, the Tchoukball C Div Girls team placed third at the national level. Lou Jun Xiang was awarded the SPF-NPCC Badge. Nathaniel Foo won the Bronze medal in the Judo Championship. Valentine Gan, Basil Ong and Hermes Ho were selected for the National Youth Squad for basketball. Celine Poh and Jacqueline Loh were awarded the 2022 Singapore Olympic Foundation - Peter Lim Scholarship.

Academically, BGSS students also perform very well. 1 in 3 students achieved a Distinction in the GCE O Level Chinese Language examination. 4 in 5 students achieved an A or B in the GCE O Level Malay Language examination. It is an excellent set of results! We are all looking forward to receiving our full results in January 2023.

The goal is not to chase medals and grades. The goal is to build <i>confidence, self-efficacy</i>, and a <i>growth mindset</i>. The best gifts that we can give to our students are these qualities that can help them thrive in an uncertain and complex future.

We celebrated our 21st anniversary this year. This is also the last year for us before we merge with Ping Yi Secondary School in 2023. Every opportunity comes with challenges, and every challenge comes with opportunities. The school will leverage on these opportunities to grow, and we will overcome challenges with optimism and resolve. During the past year, both schools have been preparing actively for the merger. My confidence is that the merger will take place smoothly, and that the merged school will be <i>bigger</i>, <i>bolder</i> and <i>better</i> than the existing one.
