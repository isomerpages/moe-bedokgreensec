A school is not the building but its people. When the people grow, the school grows.

Bedok Green Secondary School has grown tremendously in the past few years. As a Phase One school for the National Digital Learning Programme (NDLP) and a pilot school for Full Subject Based-Banding (Full-SBB), our teachers have grown significantly in the use of technology for engaged and blended learning, and also in differentiated instruction to meet the needs and strengthen the abilities of different groups of students.

A school is great because of its great teachers. This year, our teachers are recognised with multiple awards. Mr Frankie Leow is a President's Award for Teachers (PAT) Finalist and the winner of the Associate of the Academy of Singapore Teachers Award. Mr Leow also published two papers, one of which won the Best Paper Award. Miss Sheryl Seow is nominated for the Outstanding Youth In Education Award (OYEA). Mr Teo Chai Lai is given the National Day Commendation Medal. The school's Student Development Team also won the MOE Innergy Bronze Award for our school-wide anti-bullying programme, Stop!t@BGSS. We do not forget all the other dedicated and caring teachers in BGSS! You may read the students' appreciation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HIJ7Uo57UwcgveU7MxGZdZDzylHrQkgjeQu5DW6l4vk/edit#slide=id.ged38e38cf6_0_0).

Our students have grown a lot too! Our Modern Dance and Ethnic Dance clinched the Certificate of Distinction for the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation despite the pandemic. Our Drama and Concert Band did well with a Certificate of Accomplishment. In addition, two of our badminton players were awarded the Sportsmanship Award, and our Environment Club helped the school clinch the Sustained Vanda Miss Joaquim Award for the 4th time - the highest level of School Green Award.

Our students won First Prize in the Our School Our Community Photography Competition, Bronze Medal in the National School Literature Festival, 2nd Runner Up in the Singapore Energy Grand Challenge and Merit Award for the Live on Festival 2021. These are national competitions, and our students had to compete with students from all secondary schools. To be awarded is a testament to their talent and ability.

We are not chasing awards. We are building confidence.

When students experienced success and tasted the sweet fruits of their labour, they will work harder and be more optimistic about their future. With that optimism and confidence, they will become more motivated and resilient. In turn, these students will become a positive influence on their peers and uplift many others in hope and spirit.

That's how we grow the school. Great teachers, confident students.

The coming merger will catalyse our growth further. In 2023, about 200 Secondary 3 and 4 students from Ping Yi Secondary School will join us. BGSS will launch a #MyDreamSchool campaign in 2022 and invite students to suggest what they want to see in the merged school. Students will have a say in the school uniform, school rules and regulations, school programmes, school facilities, etc. It will be an educational and exciting time for our students which they will not experience in another school. The merged school will enjoy double the equipment, assets, facilities, etc., from Bedok Green Secondary School and Ping Yi Secondary School. We will also have a larger pool of talented and experienced teachers after the merger. The possibilities and opportunities are aplenty.

There is no better time to be part of Bedok Green than now. Be part of our exciting journey and grow together with us!
